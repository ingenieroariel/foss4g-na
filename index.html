        <h3>Where? ::  Indonesia</h3>
        <p>Indonesia experiences a wide range of natural hazards because it is located along major tectonic plate boundaries. It is along these boundaries that the biggest volcanoes and earthquakes happen, including those that cause tsunamis such as the one that devastated many countries in Asia in December 2004.</p>

      <article>
        <h3>Why? :: Need to improve contingency planning</h3>
        <p>BNPB has identified a priority need to improve its methodology for contingency planning with an emphasis on the use of realistic disaster scenarios as the starting point for this new, comprehensive process. BNPB has been working with AIFDR and the World Bank on a methodology and associated software tools for developing realistic disaster scenarios for contingency planning.</p>

         <h3>What? :: InaSAFE</h3>
         <p>Software tool that integrates hazard and exposure data to estimate a range of impacts of a possible disaster scenario, including:</p>
         <ul>
           <li>Number of people likely to need emergency shelter</li>
           <li>Amount of food, water, sanitation, etc required in line with BNPB’s PERKA no. 7/2008</li>
           <li>Number of schools and hospitals likely to be severely impacted (as defined by BNPB’s PERKA no. 2/2012)</li>
           <li>Roads that will be temporarily closed.</li>
         </ul>
      </article>

      <article>
         <h3>How? :: Open Source, Python based</h3>
         <p>The following were the goals we had when starting the project</p>
         <ul>
            <li>Be easy to use</li>
            <li>Allow results to be reproduced</li>
            <li>Ensure consistency across different locations and scenarios</li>
            <li>Provide a platform for near real time impact estimates such as predicted fatalities based on earthquake ground shaking.</li>
            <li>InaSAFE is Free and Open Source licensed with GPL v3</li>
         </ul>
